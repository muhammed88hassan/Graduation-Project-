# Graduation-Project-
Fully automated garbage sorting conveyor ,that takes the regular residential garbage and extracts the recyclable objects like: plastic bottles ,metal Cans using deep learning algorithm , which preforms classification and localization, finally sending the locations to the 3DOF delta robot which picks the specified objects then place them in bins. This machine has a digital twin that is connected to the machine through IOT and used to control the process through user-friendly, and interactive graphical interface.

My contributions were:

1- Exact, and detailed 3D model of the whole system using Solidworks.

2- Modeling delta robot mathematically to develop an approach to calculate its mounting height and effective workspace.

3- Building an exact digital twin of the system using Unity Perspective.

4- Establishing a connection between the system and the user through Google cloud IOT.

5- Designing classic control circuits of the whole project.

6- System Motion Scene.
